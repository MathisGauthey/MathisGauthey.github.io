# Contact me

If you're a recruiter and you want to contact me for profesionnal reasons, you should check the [about me](../about/index.md) page. You'll find my resume and personal contact informations there. ðŸ‘¤ðŸ“¨

If you're an internet stranger, I'd rather have you contact me on [this](mailto:shutupandtakemyemail@protonmail.com) email, I'll answer all the same. Don't worry about the mail adress, it's a throwaway one.

**I won't answer to any email sent to my personal email adress from people I don't know.**
