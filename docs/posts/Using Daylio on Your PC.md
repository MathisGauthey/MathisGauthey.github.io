# Using Daylio on Your PC

If you want to use Daylio on your computer, here's a way to do it by remote controlling your phone.

Hi everyone !

After asking on this sub for a PC support of Daylio in order to type long journal entries, I'm back here to help you set everything up !

The solution I've found the most simple and lightweight to use is scrcpy. Basically, it's a Vysor alternative for free and open-source.

Best (and free) android remote control from PC I've found : [https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy)

Guide to make it work wireless (same wifi) : [https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#wireless](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#wireless)

Video guides I've found to be clear and complete :

Installation : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVLgyxqhKqE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVLgyxqhKqE)

Wireless configuration : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuTdxa-w1js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuTdxa-w1js)

(Link to old post :[https://www.reddit.com/r/Daylio/comments/k02ckb/am_i_the_only_one_wanting_to_type_things_down/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daylio/comments/k02ckb/am_i_the_only_one_wanting_to_type_things_down/))

Why not using an android emulator on windows ? Because Daylio does not automatically import online backup, you'd need to manually do it every time you switch device. It is then simpler to just remote access your phone.

Have a nice day ! Hope it helps !
